# YouTube Bot Sentiment Analysis

Interested by public attitudes toward radical climate activism (think that time when protestors threw tomato soup at a Van Gogh painting and glued themselves to the museum wall), I created a bot to scrape comments from YouTube videos about protests staged by UK-based radical climate activist group 'Just Stop Oil' to conduct a sentiment analysis. Utilizing YouTube's Data API v3, the bot extracts comments from any YouTube video given a unique video ID. To further the analysis, I exclusively selected YouTube videos from the channels of various UK news organizations with different ideological slants to explore the potential link between sentiment and ideological affiliation.
